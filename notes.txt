Random design notes

Basic idea:
- choice-based interactive fiction gameplay with an underlying world model
- define a whole bunch of short scenes, each with a few choice points
- scenes are marked with requirements for the actors in them
  - e.g. person.height < 180 and area.type == 'forest' and 
         person.has(type='hood', color='red')
- scenes are written such that they can be played out from any actor's
  perspective
  - player makes decisions for one actor; computer makes decisions for other
    actors (or maybe there's potential for multiplayer, but that seems tricky)
  - means that players may eventually see the same scene from different
    perspectives (with different combination of actors)
- text for scene will need to do a bit of text-replacement to customize for
  the particular actors (names, genders, level of detail, etc)
  - hopefully can get away with just Inform-style "[Tom] puts on [his] shoes"
    and marking some sentences as only shown to some actors.
- scenes influence other scenes by modifying the actor and world-object states
  - normal python objects, functions

Weaving Scenes
- Instead of randomly selecting scenes (from the set of valid possible
  scenes given the current world-state), we can impose narrative structure
  by choosing what scene comes next.
- Not sure yet what this looks like.  Maybe scenes can be marked by their
  narrative role?
- Need to start making scenes and exploring what interactions are desired.
