Epic huge will-never-get-done ideas:

- Life simulator
  - born at random somewhere in the world
  - live out your life
    - e.g. Alter Ego: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Ego_(1986_video_game)
    - e.g. Real Lives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Lives
- Fantasy life simulator
  - born at random somewhere in a stereotypical fantasy world
  - live out your life


Slightly smaller ideas (but still probably way too huge):

- Goblin Hive
  - Chapter 1:
    - You are a random hero, wiping out a goblin infestation
    - Attack the hive, probably die a few times
      - each time you die, restart as a new randomly created hero with a new
        goblin hive
    - Eventually destroy all the goblins.
    - Last one does some strange ritual
    - You live a long and happy life, but always wonder a bit what that was...
    - (Note: chapter 1 serves to introduce game mechanics, including dying a
       lot, making choices, and generally sticks to fantasy tropes)
  - Chapters 2-N:
    - You are a random goblin, living with lots of other goblins
    - social interactions
    - job 
    - politics (how should we deal with neighbouring humans?)
    - die a lot (either through dangerous working conditions or rampaging heros)
      - scenes from chapter 1 happen, but from a very different perspective
    - goal is to complete the protection ritual
      - rampaging heroes (or other disasters) keep interfering
    - not sure what sort of gradual progression there should be here
      - maybe completing some intermediate goals will unlock being born into
        different situations?
      - sort of structured as a rogue-like, with different character classes
        to choose from?
        - e.g.: as a guard, need to successfully alert the others when the
          hero arrives; but you still die valiantly as the hero slaughters
          everyone.  Now you can choose to be born as a goblin in some other
          role.
